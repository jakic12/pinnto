# Physics-informed neural network topology optimisation (PINNTO)
This is the final project of the differential programming course on FRI.
In this project a physics-informed neural network is used instead of Finite element
analysis in the [Topology optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization) method.

Most of the code is from https://github.com/AJJLagerweij/topopt/tree/master/src_Compliance.
